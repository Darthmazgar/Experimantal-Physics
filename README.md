# Experimantal-Physics
For analysing and visualising data.

Files:
  graphing.py Takes a given set of data in the form x_data, y_data, x_error, y_error and produces a plot of the data with a bestfitting line optimised by minimising the X^2. The resiruals of the data are then given along with some statistical significance values.
  test_data.txt Some test input data to see what is produced.

Looking to add functionality to deal with non linear data. Ideally in the long run to be able to work out what type the data is i.e linear, polynomial ... to be able to fit test the data from this. 
Add more statistical significance testing.
Add any more useful data handeling tools.
